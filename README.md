## Findings and Discussion

### Unexpected Results
Despite the app’s design to deliver varied workout plans, it sometimes generates repetitive or less diverse routines. This issue can reduce user engagement and the overall effectiveness of the workout plans. Efforts to address this limitation are ongoing to enhance the app’s variability and user experience.

### Evaluation
The app has been successful in creating structured and detailed workout plans. The inclusion of cooldown videos has been well-received by users. However, feedback suggests that the app could benefit from greater exercise variety and more precise alignment with individual fitness goals. Improvements in these areas could enhance user satisfaction and effectiveness.

### Limitations
One significant limitation of the app is its reliance on preset prompts, which restricts its ability to adapt dynamically to user progress or feedback. The current selection of training styles may not cover all user preferences, which limits the app’s versatility.

### Ethics Concerns
The app assumes that users have no pre-existing health conditions, which poses a potential risk. It is essential to include clear disclaimers advising users to consult healthcare professionals before starting any new fitness program. This precaution ensures that users prioritize their health and safety.

### App’s Potential
The app has significant potential to evolve into a more valuable tool for fitness enthusiasts. By incorporating user feedback, offering more personalized recommendations, and integrating wearable technology, the app could improve its effectiveness and appeal. Future developments may include progress tracking and adaptive workout plans based on user performance.

### Future Work
Future updates could include more varied exercise routines, integration of user progress tracking, and machine learning to adapt plans based on user performance. Enhancing user interface design and expanding the training styles could also be beneficial. Additionally, addressing the response time, which currently takes around 40 seconds, will be crucial. This may involve upgrading the server’s CPU to improve processing speed, optimizing code, and implementing more efficient data handling strategies.
